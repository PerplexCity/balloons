# Balloons on Instagram!

Pretty simple (if tedious) task this week. Went through thousands of photos on instagram to collect 500 that featured birthday balloons shaped like numbers, logged the results in [bday.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/balloons/blob/master/bday.csv). That's fed into [bday.R](https://github.com/PerplexCity/balloons/blob/master/bday.R) to make the graphs.
